# My Dotfiles âš¡

This repo hosts my config files for several tools. As someone who has repeatedly
reinstalled Linux in my machine, it's a real headache to pull configs manually
(time and time) again from Github. As a result, I made use of
[chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi). This way, not only does it solve
my dilemma, but also allows me to install my configs in other machines as well.

## Usage

Clone this using:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:SuchWowEl/dottest.git ~/.local/share/chezmoi
$ cd ~/.local/share/chezmoi
$ cz update
```

## TODO

- Add
  - `.zshrc`
  - `kitty`
