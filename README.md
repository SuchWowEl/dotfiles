# My Dotfiles âš¡

This repo hosts my config files for several tools. As someone who has repeatedly
reinstalled Linux (for reasons I'd rather not discuss ðŸ’€) in my machine, it's a
real headache to pull configs manually again from Github. As a result, I made
use of [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi). This way, not only does it
solve my dilemma but also allows me to install my configs in other machines as well.

## Usage

Clone this using:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:SuchWowEl/dottest.git
```

## TODO

- Add
  - `.zshrc`
  - `kitty`
