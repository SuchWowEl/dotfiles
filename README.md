# My Dotfiles ⚡

This repo hosts my config files for several tools. It utilizes
[chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi), a dotfiles manager.

## Usage

> ℹ️ Will probably exclude the submodules so long as they're private

Clone this using:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:SuchWowEl/dottest.git
```


## Todo

- check if pulling this into a new machine works automagically
- slowly publicize submodules 👀
